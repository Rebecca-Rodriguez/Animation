# Animation

In this project, I loaded and processed a few animations that all revolve around the same core technique: linear interpolation. I loaded some animations from external files, created some simple animations in my code, and then updated/drew all of them in a single scene.

**Key features**:
* Includes a grid
* An orbit camera
* Monster animation plays forward (a positive time value sent to the Update() function)
* Monster animation plays backward (a negative time value sent to the Update() function)
* Monster animation plays forward without interpolation, but snapping to key frames
* Procedural animation, 6 moving boxes with linear interpolation
* Procedural animation, 5 moving boxes with no interpolation, but snapping to key frames
* Sphere animation loaded from file, plays and loops properly
* Procedural animation, spheroid moves around grid
